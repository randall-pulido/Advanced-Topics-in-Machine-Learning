# Advanced-Topics-in-Machine-Learning

Final paper for group project in CS 159 Advanced Topics in Machine Learning (Spring 2021).

In this paper, we explore how adversarial perturbations propagate through robust denoising systems by tracking the dissimilarity
between the adversarial feature maps and those of the original image.
